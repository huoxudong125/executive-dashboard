    <!-- Provide the URL of your application's site (or even just the URL of the server) so that only it
         may use the proxy. If this section is omitted, any application on any site in the world may use
         the proxy. -->

                <!-- Twitter requires authentication in order to search for tweets. This rule provides OAuth 2
                     authentication for the app. This authentication is a two-step process: the rule asks
                     Twitter for a "bearer token" using credentials defined below, then the proxy is able
                     to use this token to make searches. The proxy caches the bearer token for the period
                     specified below.
                     To generate application-level authentication credentials, go to https://dev.twitter.com/apps
                     and log into your Twitter account. Click the "Create a new application" button in the
                     upper-right corner. Provide a Name that's unique across Twitter. Provide a Description and
                     Website as you see fit; leave Callback blank. Agree to the rules and fill in the Captcha,
                     then click the "Create your Twitter application" button. Click the "Create my access token"
                     button.  If, after the page refreshes, it has not changed to "Recreate my access token",
                     click it again. Go to the "OAuth tool" tab and copy the OAuth Consumer key, Consumer secret,
                     Access token, and Access token secret to the the credentials (below). -->
